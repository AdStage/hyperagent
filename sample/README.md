# HALTalk hyperagent.js Demo

This is a simple example application accessing the
[haltalk API](http://haltalk.herokuapp.com/explorer/browser.html) through a CORS
proxy.

It showcases how to use hyperagent.js to access an API while sharing as little
knowledge as possible about the structure of the data as well as how to receive it and
drive the application state completely through hypermedia.

The demo uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [CORS
Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/).

## Running

To run the demo, install the dependencies with bower and start open the
index.html.

```bash
bower install
open index.html # or xdg-open
```
