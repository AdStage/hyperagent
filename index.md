    <strong>Loose Coupling</strong>
    <br>
    Reduce the coupling between your server and the client by letting
    hypermedia drive the state of your application.

<p>
    <strong>Lazy</strong>
    <br>
    Objects are created on access using ES5 getters, reducing the memory
    footprint and allowing recursive structures.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Framework Agnostic</strong>
    <br>
    AngularJS, Ember.js, Backbone &hellip; you name it! hyperagent.js provides a generic
    interface that can be combined with your favorite framework.
